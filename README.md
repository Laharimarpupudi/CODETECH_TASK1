**Title:** Basic Python Calculator

**Description:**
The Basic Python Calculator is a simple command-line program designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. Upon execution, the program prompts the user to enter two numbers and select an operation from addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Once the user provides the required inputs, the program calculates the result based on the chosen operation and displays it to the user.

**Features:**
- User-friendly interface with clear instructions.
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Handles both integer and floating-point numbers.
- Provides accurate results with appropriate error handling.
- Lightweight and easy to use, suitable for beginners learning Python programming.

**Usage:**
1. Launch the program.
2. Input the first number.
3. Input the second number.
4. Select the desired operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
5. View the result displayed on the screen.

**Example output

**Implementation:**
- The program utilizes Python's built-in input function to receive user input.
- It employs conditional statements and arithmetic operators to perform the selected operation.
- Error handling is implemented to manage invalid inputs, such as division by zero or non-numeric entries.


**Future Enhancements:**
- Addition of more advanced mathematical functions (exponentiation, square root, etc.).
- Graphical user interface (GUI) implementation for improved interaction.
- Support for complex numbers and scientific notation.
